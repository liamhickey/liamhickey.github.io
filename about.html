<h1>About<br></h1>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I am a Software Engineering student at Carleton University in Ottawa. Most of my life has been spent taking things apart and figuring out how they work, I enjoy working most when there is a hardware component that I can have a chance to play around with. My interest in programming began in grade 9 when I went to "bring your kid to work day" with my father. He worked originally as a programmer, and hardware technologist and later became a project manager for a software integration team.<br></p>

<h2>My Programming History</h2>
<p>I took "computer science" courses in high school, more akin to Java 101, the first language I was exposed to. In university I realized how much I hated Java, and preferred languages like C, or even Assembly. I like to create design diagrams and know what I need to do rather than just winging it, and taking twice as long to come up with a product poorly designed and full of holes.<br></p>

<h1>Past And Current Work<br></h1>

<h2>Polar</h2>
<p>My first work term was at an ad-tach company called Polar, previously Polarmobile. They started out helping publishers get their content on the mobile platform, later focussing on Advertising what they called Native Ads, or Branded content. This was the idea of ads which featured products being marketed, a softer, more digestable form of ads less likely to be skipped over.<br></p>

<p>At Polar worked on their center facing software Mediavoice to allow publishers to manage ad campaigns, locations, durations, etc. I developed in a veriety of languages used throughout the evolution of the website. The framework was Django/python, and the dynamics were a mix of coffeescript, React, and JQuery. They also used a markup language for HTML called HAML, interesting if a little pedantic. I learned a lot in the 4 months that I was there about version control with git, the unix shell, ticketing systems, software process, and a vibrant mix of web development that I have yet to reapply.<br></p>

<h2>Geotab</h2>
<p>As of January 2018 I am at second software job at Geotab as an Automotive Intern. Geotab is a telematics company providing vehicle data for fleet management, examples of their customers are Orkin Trucking, UPS delivery, and DHL logistics. They produce a devices which queries the engine computer for data, as well as provides GPS data real time to Geotab hosted servers.<br></p>

<p>I have been introducted to a wide number of protocols on the automotive CAN bus, Heavy-duty Engine controllers, multi-message transmission protocols, and Firmware reflashing protocols. The automotive department is responsible for retreiving all of the rich telematics data that Geotab provides to their customers. Everything from the voltage on the engine coolant sensor to seatbelt usage is gathered from the vehicles. Automotive also writes the firmware for the telematics devices. At Geotab there is one device for every type of vehicle from a Toyota Echo to a Peterbuilt, to a Chevy Volt. I am learning about proper real-time programming, and embedded firware development practices such as methods for designing systems of state machines to provide functionality for new features, and memory management to handle the high demand for real estate on the devices.<br></p>
